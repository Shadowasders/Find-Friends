  ## Project Description
  Find Friends is an interactive twitter-esqe database. In the database users can sign up with a username & email, add friends, write thoughts, and react to others thoughts! I started this project to get some more experience with MongoDB and mongoose, to futher familarize myself with the back-end

  ## Installation
  Download the files from github, use npm i to unpack the dependencies and go to town! Note: There is no seed file, so check out the user, thought and reaction models to see what you need to insert some dummy data to play with.

  ## Usage
  If you need some ideas on how to create a small social media database, if you need a refresher on how mongoDB schemas and collections work, or if you just want to mess around and make some funny posts, Find Friends is here for you!

  ## How to Contribute
  Currently I do not have a seed function, adding that is the largest contribution I could ask for, besides that, general cleaning of the code

  ## Testing
  Try adding really long posts! Use a crazy email and see if it's validated, try chaining friends, reactions, and thoughts together and see if it breaks! The sky is the limit!
